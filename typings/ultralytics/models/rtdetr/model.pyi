"""
Interface for Baidu's RT-DETR, a Vision Transformer-based real-time object detector. RT-DETR offers real-time
performance and high accuracy, excelling in accelerated backends like CUDA with TensorRT. It features an efficient
hybrid encoder and IoU-aware query selection for enhanced detection accuracy.

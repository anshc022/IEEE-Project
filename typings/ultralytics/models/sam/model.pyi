SAM model interface.

This module provides an interface to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from Ultralytics, designed for real-time image
segmentation tasks. The SAM model allows for promptable segmentation with unparalleled versatility in image analysis,
and has been trained on the SA-1B dataset. It features zero-shot performance capabilities, enabling it to adapt to new
image distributions and tasks without prior knowledge.

Key Features:
    - Promptable segmentation
    - Real-time performance
    - Zero-shot transfer capabilities
    - Trained on SA-1B dataset

    SAM (Segment Anything Model) interface class for real-time image segmentation tasks.

    This class provides an interface to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from Ultralytics, designed for
    promptable segmentation with versatility in image analysis. It supports various prompts such as bounding
    boxes, points, or labels, and features zero-shot performance capabilities.

    Attributes:
        model (torch.nn.Module): The loaded SAM model.
        is_sam2 (bool): Indicates whether the model is SAM2 variant.
        task (str): The task type, set to "segment" for SAM models.

    Methods:
        predict: Performs segmentation prediction on the given image or video source.
        info: Logs information about the SAM model.

    Examples:
        >>> sam = SAM("sam_b.pt")
        >>> results = sam.predict("image.jpg", points=[[500, 375]])
        >>> for r in results:

        Initializes the SAM (Segment Anything Model) instance.

        Args:
            model (str): Path to the pre-trained SAM model file. File should have a .pt or .pth extension.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: If the model file extension is not .pt or .pth.

        Examples:
            >>> sam = SAM("sam_b.pt")

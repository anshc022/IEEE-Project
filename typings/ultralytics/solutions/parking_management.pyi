class ParkingPtsSelection:
    """
    A class for selecting and managing parking zone points on images using a Tkinter-based UI.

    This class provides functionality to upload an image, select points to define parking zones, and save the
    selected points to a JSON file. It uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

    Attributes:
        tk (module): The Tkinter module for GUI operations.
        filedialog (module): Tkinter's filedialog module for file selection operations.
        messagebox (module): Tkinter's messagebox module for displaying message boxes.
        master (tk.Tk): The main Tkinter window.
        canvas (tk.Canvas): The canvas widget for displaying the image and drawing bounding boxes.
        image (PIL.Image.Image): The uploaded image.
        canvas_image (ImageTk.PhotoImage): The image displayed on the canvas.
        rg_data (List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]): List of bounding boxes, each defined by 4 points.
        current_box (List[Tuple[int, int]]): Temporary storage for the points of the current bounding box.
        imgw (int): Original width of the uploaded image.
        imgh (int): Original height of the uploaded image.
        canvas_max_width (int): Maximum width of the canvas.
        canvas_max_height (int): Maximum height of the canvas.

    Methods:
        initialize_properties: Initializes the necessary properties.
        upload_image: Uploads an image, resizes it to fit the canvas, and displays it.
        on_canvas_click: Handles mouse clicks to add points for bounding boxes.
        draw_box: Draws a bounding box on the canvas.
        remove_last_bounding_box: Removes the last bounding box and redraws the canvas.
        redraw_canvas: Redraws the canvas with the image and all bounding boxes.
        save_to_json: Saves the bounding boxes to a JSON file.

    Examples:
        >>> parking_selector = ParkingPtsSelection()
        >>> # Use the GUI to upload an image, select parking zones, and save the data

class ParkingManagement(BaseSolution):
    """
    Manages parking occupancy and availability using YOLO model for real-time monitoring and visualization.

    This class extends BaseSolution to provide functionality for parking lot management, including detection of
    occupied spaces, visualization of parking regions, and display of occupancy statistics.

    Attributes:
        json_file (str): Path to the JSON file containing parking region details.
        json (List[Dict]): Loaded JSON data containing parking region information.
        pr_info (Dict[str, int]): Dictionary storing parking information (Occupancy and Available spaces).
        arc (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for available region visualization.
        occ (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for occupied region visualization.
        dc (Tuple[int, int, int]): RGB color tuple for centroid visualization of detected objects.

    Methods:
        process_data: Processes model data for parking lot management and visualization.

    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.solutions import ParkingManagement
        >>> parking_manager = ParkingManagement(model="yolo11n.pt", json_file="parking_regions.json")

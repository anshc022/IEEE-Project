MLflow Logging for Ultralytics YOLO.

This module enables MLflow logging for Ultralytics YOLO. It logs metrics, parameters, and model artifacts.
For setting up, a tracking URI should be specified. The logging can be customized using environment variables.

Commands:
    1. To set a project name:
        `export MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME=<your_experiment_name>` or use the project=<project> argument

    2. To set a run name:
        `export MLFLOW_RUN=<your_run_name>` or use the name=<name> argument

    3. To start a local MLflow server:
        mlflow server --backend-store-uri runs/mlflow
       It will by default start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
       To specify a different URI, set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable.

    4. To kill all running MLflow server instances:
        ps aux | grep 'mlflow' | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

    Log training parameters to MLflow at the end of the pretraining routine.

    This function sets up MLflow logging based on environment variables and trainer arguments. It sets the tracking URI,
    experiment name, and run name, then starts the MLflow run if not already active. It finally logs the parameters
    from the trainer.

    Args:
        trainer (ultralytics.engine.trainer.BaseTrainer): The training object with arguments and parameters to log.

    Global:
        mlflow: The imported mlflow module to use for logging.

    Environment Variables:
        MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI: The URI for MLflow tracking. If not set, defaults to 'runs/mlflow'.
        MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME: The name of the MLflow experiment. If not set, defaults to trainer.args.project.
        MLFLOW_RUN: The name of the MLflow run. If not set, defaults to trainer.args.name.
        MLFLOW_KEEP_RUN_ACTIVE: Boolean indicating whether to keep the MLflow run active after the end of training.
